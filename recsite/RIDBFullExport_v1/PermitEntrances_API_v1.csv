You will be gaining elevation (a total of 4,800 feet) most of your way to the top of Half Dome. Most say the reward is worth the effort.

Beginning in the early 70s, anyone who wanted to could drive the road after the bus system shut down for the season in mid-September. In those early years, only a few intrepid souls braved the poor roads to get here and drive into the park.  As the years went by, the popularity of this opportunity to visit the park in late autumn grew. In the late 80s the open to all comers offer became unmanageable when almost 2000 vehicles per day came into the park. There were traffic jams, people camping illegally, problems with pets and wildlife, food storage and sanitation. In 1990, park management decided to implement a lottery where people could apply for a chance to drive the road over a period of four days after the bus season ended.

One year later, the Civilian Conservation Corps built a trail and a small tree stand overlooking Pack Creek (this stand was replaced with the current tower in 1990).In the mid-1950s a gentleman by the name of Stan Price floated his wannigan float house into the Pack Creek estuary. Over the next several decades his year round presence was a significant factor in conditioning the bears to humans. By the time of his passing in 1989 the bears were comfortable with daily visitors from Juneau.The Alaska Board of Game expanded the hunting closure in 1984 to include Swan Cove, Swan Island and Windfall Harbor -- a total of about 95 square miles.","281","Pack Creek Bear Viewing","Entry Point",""

Immediately below the confluence with Moose Creek, the increased gradient of 50 feet per mile combined with a major increased volume of flow creates an extremely demanding technical section of the river.
